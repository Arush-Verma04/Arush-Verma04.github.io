        Hi, I'm Arush Verma, a Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, graduating in May 2025. My focus areas include Intelligence and Information Networks, and I have a strong passion for leveraging AI and machine learning to solve real-world challenges. Through my work experiences, I have gained expertise in software development, data analysis, scalable systems design, and the integration of modern technologies like machine learning pipelines as well the full stack experience. As a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Systems and Networks course (CS 2200), I developed skills in mentoring, technical communication, and problem-solving. My internships at Readyly and John Deere have strengthened my ability to design and deploy efficient workflows, build data-driven models, and implement full-stack solutions. Starting next semester, I will pursue my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, focusing on AI and systems. This summer, I will be joining Amazon as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern, where I look forward to building innovative solutions at scale and tackling complex engineering challenges.
