          <h2>Software Engineering Intern at Readyly</h2>
          <p>
            As a Software Engineering Intern at Readyly, I developed a scalable content ingestion module that extracted and organized information from various web sources into a Neo4j knowledge graph with 92% accuracy. I engineered a multi-modal Chat Assist feature utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a neural re-ranking system, improving response relevance by 37% and reducing query response time by 25%. Additionally, I integrated OpenAI models and designed a unified API that supported both text and voice interactions, improving user compatibility across multiple platforms.

          <h2>Data Science Intern at John Deere</h2>
          <p>
            At John Deere, I worked on the Sustainability Solutions Team, where I scaled a Python script on an AWS EC2 server, increasing the amount of sustainability data processed from farms across 15 states by 50%. I leveraged satellite imagery to predict tillage patterns with 76% accuracy and applied a linear regression model to estimate CO2 emission impacts under different agricultural conditions. Additionally, my work in querying sustainability data from an S3 bucket over a five-year period contributed to a 31% increase in sustainability-focused customers.

          <h2>Teaching Assistant - Georgia Tech (CS 2200)</h2>
          <p>
            As a Teaching Assistant for Georgia Tech’s Computer Systems and Networks (CS 2200) course, I provided mentorship and technical guidance to over 200 students, helping them develop a strong understanding of low-level systems programming, networking concepts, and operating systems. I led weekly office hours, assisted in grading assignments, and contributed to refining lab exercises and course materials. This role enhanced my communication, problem-solving, and leadership skills while solidifying my expertise in systems programming and computer architecture.
