                    <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Modern Cryptocurrency Trading</h2>
                    <p>This project applied advanced reinforcement learning techniques to cryptocurrency trading, focusing on Bitcoin. Using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) models, we developed agents capable of optimizing buy, sell, and hold strategies based on historical price data. Our approach also compared these methods to a baseline Bollinger Bands strategy. Results revealed that PPO outperformed DQN in handling market volatility, achieving a modest total return of 4.91% with minimal risk.</p>

                    <h2>Iris - Navigation Aid for the Blind</h2>
                    <p>The Iris project is a Swift-based iOS application designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings. Using real-time object detection powered by a YOLO model, the app continuously captures environmental data through the iPhone camera. I developed the user interface and integrated a text-to-speech (TTS) system to provide spoken feedback about detected obstacles. This project was focused on accessibility and improving the independence of visually impaired users.</p>

                    <h2>Dungeon Crawler</h2>
                    <p>Dungeon Crawler is an interactive game built in Android Studio, featuring a player navigating through a dynamically generated dungeon environment. I implemented the game's interaction mechanics, including enemy behaviors, movement physics, and level progression. As the lead developer, I structured the game architecture using Agile methodologies and created UML diagrams, including Sequence Diagrams and System Sequence Diagrams, to map out the design.</p>

                    <h2>Orbital Dynamics</h2>
                    <p>In this project, I developed a predictive model for tracking celestial bodies using machine learning. I trained a linear regression model on 250 data points to estimate the position of a comet over time, while also computing its velocity and acceleration. By scaling the model to different celestial objects, I demonstrated its adaptability in predicting orbital paths. The final analysis and visualizations were done using Matplotlib to illustrate real-time orbital movements.</p>
